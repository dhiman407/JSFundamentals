# Functions
It allows you to store piece of code that does a single task inside a defined block. In JavaScript, functions are objects, because they can have properties and methods just like any other object.

```js
function printName(name){
  console.log(name);
}

typeof printName; // "function"
printName();// Invoking functions
```
